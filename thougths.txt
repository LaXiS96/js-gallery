gesture detector only handles pointer events and detects gestures
gallery then interprets those gestures based on its state

use requestAnimationFrame for efficiency

can we use the concept of "ongoing gesture" for the drag/swipe gesture?

Gestures: 
- TAP
    primary down
    primary up within 300ms
- LONG PRESS
    primary down for at least 300ms
    primary up (ignore)
- DOUBLE TAP
    primary down
    primary up
    primary down within 300ms
    primary up
- DRAG [THIS NEEDS TO BE HANDLED IN REAL TIME]
    primary down
    primary move
    primary up
- PINCH [INCLUDE TOLERANCE]
    2x down
